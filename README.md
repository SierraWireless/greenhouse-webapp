Install it
==========================
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Bower: `$ sudo npm install -g bower`.
    * `-g` means _globally_, so it will be available system wide.
3. Go to the greenhouse root folder.
4. Install server application dependencies: `$ npm install`.
    * `npm` will use `package.json` to fectch dependencies.
    * Without `-g`, packages will be available only from this projects.
5. Go to `app/`: `$ cd app/`.
6. Install UI dependencies using `bower`: `$ bower install`.
    * `bower` will use `component.json` to fectch dependencies.
    * They will also be available only for this project.
7. You're good to go.

__Note__: You could also run all this at once from repository root:
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g bower && npm install && cd app/ && bower install && cd ..
```
